An example of using my [ESP Panel API](https://github.com/codewitch-honey-crisis/htcw_esp_panel) with [LVGL 9.x](https://lvgl.io) and PlatformIO

This is a complete package running the LVGL benchmark on up to 16 different devices, or one you define in include/custom_panel.h and platformio.ini

It should be easy to spin new projects off this code, even projects that target many devices with a single codebase.
